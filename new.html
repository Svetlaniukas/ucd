/* Practice Validating */ 
I tried out this W3C CSS validator, and here's what I think.
 At first, it seems a bit complicated because there's a lot on
  the screen, but actually, it's straightforward. You can upload
  your CSS file or just copy-paste your code into it, and the site checks everything for you.

I was surprised at how detailed the validator explains the errors.
 It not only showed where I went wrong but also explained how to fix it.
  A couple of times I had to think because not all errors were clear
   to me right away, but eventually, I figured out how to correct them.

I would recommend this validator to my friends.
 It doesn't just point out errors but helps understand
  how to fix them. Moreover, it's a good way to learn how
   to write code cleaner and more professionally.
    Overall, a handy tool!
